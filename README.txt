                                                         Movie-Trailer-Website


This project will build a Movie Trailer Website where users can see my favorite movies and
 watch the trailers.


WHAT'S INCLUDED
:
Within the download you'll find the following files:
- 
1. media.py

2. entertainment_center.py

3. fresh_tomatoes.py

4. README.txt


*

The Movie Class in the media.py module creates a data structure to store your favorite 
movies, including movie title, poster image and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.



*The entertainment_center.py file creates multiple instances of that Movie Class to represent
 your favorite movies and 
groups all the instances together in a list.



*The Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py has a function called open_movies_page that
 takes in one argument, 
which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes
 all of your favorite movies.
